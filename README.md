[`turbocommit` is a CLI tool written in Rust](https://crates.io/crates/turbocommit) that generates commit messages in accordance with the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. It uses the git diff to create commit messages that accurately reflect the changes made to a repository.

## Installation

turbocommit can be easily installed with Cargo, Rust's package manager. Simply run the following command:

```bash
cargo install turbocommit
```

Please note that in order to use turbocommit, you will need to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. This API key is required to use the OpenAI `gpt-3.5-turbo` language model, which is used by turbocommit to generate commit messages.

## Usage

When you have staged some changes, you can run the `turbocommit` (I recommend making a `tc` symlink)

### Handling Long `git diff`

In some cases, the `git diff` for staged changes may be too long to fit within the 4096-token limit enforced by the language model, which `turbocommit` uses to generate commit messages. When this happens, `turbocommit` will prompt you with a message indicating that the `git diff` is too long.

To address this, `turbocommit` provides a list of all staged files and ask you to select any number of them. The tool will then generate a new `git diff` that includes only the changes from the selected files. If the resulting `git diff` plus the system prompt is still too long, `turbocommit` will repeat the process until the `git diff` is short enough to be processed by the AI model.

This allows you to generate conventional commit messages with `turbocommit` while ensuring that the `git diff` is short enough to be processed by the AI model.

### Getting Help with `turbocommit`

To get help with using `turbocommit`, you can use the `-h` or `--help` option

```bash
$ turbocommit --help
```

This will display the help message with information on how to use the tool.
